  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

*I learned about different HTML Tags, researching HTML tags, and using them. I learned how to code simple mockups.
*Formatting, html tags, and basic web development has been easy.
  Adding images were a little challenging at first, but I seem to be getting the hang of it now.
  Adding links to text or images has also been easy.
*Alignments are very difficult.
*I have been using online resources to look up tags and code errors that I do not understand.
  I had an error with the src of the image, and looking it up really helped.
  It turned out that my link was incorrect, as it was repeating the folder location that was already implied.
  Removing that solved the error.
